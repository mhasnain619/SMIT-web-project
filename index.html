                <p>Why do New Yorkers keep pigeons?
                    Better known as rooftop fliers or pigeon fliers, for these New Yorkers, raising pigeons is a
                    'salvation from the stresses of daily life and the distractions of the street. ' The New York Times
                    looked into the subculture recently as a means of crossing racial lines

        <p>Pigeons are gentle, plump, small-billed birds with a skin saddle (cere) between the bill and forehead. All
            pigeons strut about with a characteristic bobbing of the head. Because of their long wings and powerful
            flight muscles, they are strong, swift fliers.</p>

        <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by
            feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered
            heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2
            in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species,
            more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies
            according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings,
            which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss
            of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and
            respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic
            environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming</p>
